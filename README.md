### Fix AADClientId and AADClientSecret in codes
1. Copy `CLIENT ID` and paste it in [this line](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMExplorer/blob/master/Modules/ARMOAuthModule.cs#L38), replacing `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AADClientId")`.
2. On `Keys` section, create a client secret. Copy the key and paste it in the same file, replacing `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AADClientSecret")`.


Test with localhost
1. In VS, make Slingshot.Api the starter project. The RedirectionSite project can be ignored.
1. Starting running it in the debugger (F5).
1. In browser, it should redirect to login page.
1. Enter AAD account and password.
  Note: try account that is not in the same directly as the application.
  Note: currently this does not work with MSA account.
1. You should be prompt with OAuth allow/deny page, do accept it.

2. `https://localhost:44306/api/tenants` - show all tenants (AAD directory) user belongs to.
3. and so on.. 

### Test with Azure Websites
1. Create Azure Websites with local git publishing enabled
2. Add the site https url as the reply URL for AAD application
3. Deploy the website by pushing the repository
4. Set AADClientID and AADClientSecret appSettings
5. To test, simply browse to the website and append the query string "?repository=<url of your Git repository>"
